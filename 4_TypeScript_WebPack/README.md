In this project, we'll Transpile TypeScript code in a single bundle file using webpack. The advantage of this is to reduce HTTP discovery for each file.


Changes

* Modules are not being imported with file extension in source code.
* `$ npm run build` to generate the bundle file for prod
* `$ npm run de:build` to generate the bundle file for dev environment
