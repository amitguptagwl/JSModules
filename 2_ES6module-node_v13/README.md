As you can notice in this folder, we've not created package.json. But still if you're on node v13 then you can run `$ node src/main.mjs`.

Note that all the files/modules being imported in `main.mjs` has `.mjs` extension. And are imported with `filename.ext`.

Please note that like *1_es6-module*, we can include this in index.html directly and can generate ES5 script from this for old browser support.
