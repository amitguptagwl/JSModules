As you can notice in this folder, we've created package.json with `"type":"module"`. You can run `$ node src/main.js`. 

Note that all the files/modules can be in `.js` or `.mjs` format. But file extesion is must to import the module. 

Please note that like *1_es6-module*, we can include this in index.html directly and can generate ES5 script from this for old browser support.
